# 10 things more than the other 10 things

# Sorting in R

It's quite common to need to sort a dataset in order to see which areas, people or organisations are doing worst or best. 

* R-Bloggers have written a tutorial on [Sorting a data frame by the contents of a column](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-sorting-a-data-frame-by-the-contents-of-a-column/)
* The process is [explained more simply here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/sorting.html)

You can [see an example of this in practice (and work on a real dataset) here](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rough-sleeping/blob/master/roughsleeping.Rmd)

# Working with SPSS and Stata files

I've [written a project here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/stata_spss/stata-spss-election-survey.Rmd) which shows how to grab election survey data in either Stata or SPSS formats and export as CSV.

FiveThirtyEight's story [The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywoodâ€™s Exclusion of Women](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) was written with the help of R. You can [read the methodology behind the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-bechdel-test-checking-our-work/) and on FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repo [you will find a folder containing an R script and the data it uses](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel).

Some of the repos for the BBC Data Unit also include R script in RMarkdown: for example [look for the Rmd files in this repo for a story about art collections](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/art-uk) or [this RMarkdown file explaining how to work with migration data in R](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/internal-migration-london/blob/master/convert_matrix_to_table.Rmd)
