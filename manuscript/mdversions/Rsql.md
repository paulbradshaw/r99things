## Performing SQL queries with R

You can use R to run SQL queries, using the [`sqldf` library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sqldf/sqldf.pdf). You can find [instructions on R Bloggers here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/make-r-speak-sql-with-sqldf/)

If you want to filter a dataset based on one column containing a particular string, you can use `grep`. [This Stack Overflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13043928/selecting-rows-where-a-column-has-a-string-like-hsa-partial-string-match) explains some methods, as does [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21311386/using-grep-to-help-subset-a-data-frame-in-r)

You can also find an explanation of how to combine `grep` with **regular expressions** [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html)
