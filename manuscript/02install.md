# Installing R and RStudio

Before starting this book you will need to install R - the programming language - and RStudio (software that makes it easier to write and run R scripts).

You can install R [on your PC](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) [or Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) from the links below:

* [Install R on a Windows PC](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* [Install R on a Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

Installing R will also install the **R Console**, which *can* be used to work with R. Most people, however, use R within the more user-friendly [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and that's what I'll be using throughout this book:

* [Download and install RStudio from here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/).

Installation should be straightforward but if you need a guide to installation I recommend [this first video from a YouTube playlist about R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDrYUqNrHg&index=1&list=PLvhG5FRoq78otMp0WbWuJsFOarEAchMek) by Gordon Anthony Davis. The rest of the playlist is a good introduction, too, if you like to learn by watching.

## Creating a new project

One of the advantages of RStudio is that it works with 'projects' that save the history of all your actions. This means not only can you trace back what you have done, but you can share that history with others. So if an editor, colleague or reader asks 'How did you do that?', you can show them.

Before you start a new project create a folder for it to sit in. This might be within a broader project folder where you're storing other material related to your story, it might be within a folder where you do all your R work. Or you might be one of those people who puts everything on their desktop and then wonders why it takes so long for their computer to boot up (*ahem.*).

Then, to create a new project in R Studio click on **File > New project...**, click **Existing Directory** on the window that appears, then browse to the folder you have created for your project and select it.

Once you've created a new project R will create a new file in that folder ending with the extension *.Rproj*. This is where all the history is stored, and something you can share with others or store as a backup.
