# Introduction: the inverted pyramid of data journalism

In 2011 I published [The inverted pyramid of data journalism](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2011/07/07/the-inverted-pyramid-of-data-journalism/) - an attempt to codify the separate processes of data journalism projects and the different challenges involved - from compiling data in the first place, to cleaning it, combining it, putting it into context and communicating the stories it.

This book will take you through those 5 Cs while showing you how to use R. 

I've structured the book so that it follows those Cs - so you'll find sections devoted to each - but data journalism often involves circling back: you may have to compile more data in order to combine it with existing dataset, or clean it; you often have to combine data to put it into context. So you'll find sections where methods are combined too.
